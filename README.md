# ASA_Update Script

Script used to mass udpate ASA firewalls. 

There are 2 Primary Uses. Single use and multi use.

For single use, run the script as is and provide a single IP for a ASA Device.

For Multi use, create a file in the script directory called list.txt with a list
of IPs (1 IP Per Line).

If the script detects a list.txt, it will prompt asking if you want to use it.
